# safebook

GUI with UserLogin Using Md5 hash with salt.

safeCracker(crackEngine) might be implemented in the future, but for now its a standalone app: https://github.com/Disce-et-facere/SafeCracker

Crackengine is supposed to utilize CUDA but i dont have the time to learn that for now... and that is why safeCracker will be using cpu for know and is a standalone because the Gui is already using to many threads for CrackEngine to be "usable" with cpu threads.

TODO's for the future:
1. Implement cuda
2. Gui thread optimization
